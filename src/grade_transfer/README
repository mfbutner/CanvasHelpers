1. Create an instance of UserInterface class (start.py)
2. In the UserInterface class (user_interface.py),
   2.1 Ask user for the following information: Canvas url, Canvas token, and the path to the downloaded third party CSV
       grade file
       (?? third party CSV grade file ?? Better name??)
   2.2 Build a connection to Canvas using the Canvas url and token that user just gave, and ask user for the course and
       assignment(s) to which they want to transfer grades.
   2.3 Provide user with the head of the third party CSV file, and ask user to identify what's inside the header by
       filling in a list of the column size with numbers 0-n where 0 means None (not important for this grade transfer),
       1 means first_name, 2 means last_name, 3 means full_name, 4 means sid, 5 means email, 6-n means the assignment(s)
       to which the user want to transfer grades.
       NOTE: ONLY 0 is allowed to be repeated in the array; other numbers can appear AT MOST once.
   2.4 Create an instance of CanvasGradeTransfer class using the Canvas course (2.2), CSV header (2.3), and CSV path
       (2.1).


NOTE: 1. If leftover students (the one who can't match by sid or email absolutely) do NOT have unique names, then their
         grades will NOT be transferred by this program. You must do it manually.

      2. Only leftover 3rd party csv students (if any) (after both 1st and 2nd degree match) will be shown to the screen
         after grade transfer is done. Attention to them because it may require you to manually transfer them. Also, you
         won't be told which Canvas students left un-transferred.

      3. Course must be favorites. I didn't ask for others.
